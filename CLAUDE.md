# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

### Frontend

All frontend commands must be run from the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev      # Start Next.js dev server
npm run build    # Production build
npm run lint     # ESLint (flat config, eslint.config.mjs)
```

### Backend

All backend commands must be run from the `backend/` directory:

```bash
cd backend
uv sync                                              # Install dependencies
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload                  # Start dev server (port 8000)
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message"   # Generate migration
uv run alembic upgrade head                           # Apply migrations
uv run ruff check .                                   # Lint
uv run ruff format .                                  # Format
uv run pytest                                         # Run tests
uv run pytest tests/test_price_fetcher.py::test_name  # Run a single test
```

PostgreSQL must be running locally (e.g. `brew services start postgresql@16`). Verify with `pg_isready`. `docker-compose.yml` (+ `backend/Dockerfile`) exists for containerized runs.

Backend env vars are configured in `backend/.env` (see `.env.example`). Vars: `DATABASE_URL` (**required** — no source-code default so the credentialed connection string lives only in `.env`; example format `postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/kabuka`), `CORS_ORIGINS` (JSON array, default: `["http://localhost:3000"]`), `DEBUG` (default: `false`), `FINNHUB_API_KEY` (default: empty — themes/news endpoints return empty and the frontend falls back to mock when unset), `SEC_USER_AGENT` (descriptive User-Agent with contact info SEC EDGAR requires for the `/api/institutions` 13F fetches; a generic default works but set your own name/email in `.env`).

Frontend env var: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (default: `http://localhost:8000`) — the backend base URL.

There is a second, frontend-scoped `frontend/CLAUDE.md` covering the Next.js app in more depth.

## Project Overview

**Kabuka (株価)** is a stock research app with a Japanese woodblock-print aesthetic. The frontend fetches real data from the backend API, falling back to deterministic mock data (seeded RNG) when the backend or a data source is unavailable. Live sources:

- **ApeWisdom** — trending tickers (mention counts, ranks, velocity)
- **yfinance** — quotes, daily OHLC candles, fundamentals
- **CNN Fear & Greed** — the dashboard "Market Season" gauge (overall + VIX / Put-Call / Breadth sub-indicators)
- **Finnhub** — "Today's Themes" (general market news), per-ticker news headlines (the stock detail "Why this sentiment"), the economic-events calendar (CPI/FOMC/jobs — the `/events` page), and the earnings calendar (the `/earnings` page)
- **yfinance (Yahoo Finance)** — also powers institutional ownership (top 13F/N-PORT holders + ownership %) on the stock detail page (free, no key; falls back to deterministic mock when a ticker has no coverage)

Reddit crowd data — sentiment timeline, mention-volume bars, sparklines, and social posts — is always mock (no live source). The stock-detail Five-Petal scorecard is now mostly live: the Value/Growth/Quality/Momentum pillars are computed server-side from real yfinance fundamentals + candles (`backend/app/services/scoring.py`), while the Sentiment pillar stays mock crowd data; the whole scorecard falls back to mock when live fundamentals are unavailable. Three background tasks keep the data fresh: ApeWisdom trending every 10 minutes, yfinance prices every 5 minutes, CNN Fear & Greed market-season every hour. The frontend was implemented from an HTML/CSS/JS prototype exported from Claude Design (see `frontend/project/Kabuka.dc.html` and `frontend/chats/` for original design intent).

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js 16 with App Router, React 19, TypeScript (strict mode)
- Pure inline styles — no CSS framework. `app/globals.css` has only resets and keyframe animations.
- All charts are pure SVG with pixel geometry pre-computed in `lib/series.ts` — no charting library.
- Path alias: `@/*` maps to `frontend/` root

### Backend
- Python 3.12+, FastAPI, Uvicorn
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async) + asyncpg, Alembic migrations
- PostgreSQL 16 (local install via Homebrew)
- Package management: uv (pyproject.toml + uv.lock)
- HTTP clients: httpx (ApeWisdom, CNN Fear & Greed, Finnhub — all async), yfinance (stock quotes, OHLC history, fundamentals — synchronous, run in a thread executor)

## Architecture

### Frontend Routes

- `/` — Dashboard: trending stocks table (real data from backend), market season branch, themes sidebar
- `/events` — Economic-events calendar (CPI/FOMC/jobs) from Finnhub, rendered as a paginated, date-grouped "almanac" (`EventsBoard`) with impact discs (high/medium/low); falls back to mock
- `/earnings` — Upcoming earnings schedule from Finnhub, rendered as a paginated, date-grouped "almanac" (`EarningsBoard`) with dawn/dusk session markers; rows link to the stock detail page; falls back to mock
- `/institutions` — Big-institution directory: a grid of "hanko seal" cards (name, category, 13F portfolio value + reporting quarter) from SEC EDGAR; falls back to mock. `/institutions/[slug]` shows that institution's latest 13F holdings (`HoldingsBoard`: paginated, weight-bars, rows deep-link to `/stock/[ticker]` when the CUSIP resolves)
- `/stock/[ticker]` — Stock detail: candlestick chart, sentiment timeline, mention volume, fundamentals, institutional ownership (Yahoo Finance donut + top-holder bars), scorecard pillars, social posts

### Backend API Endpoints

All endpoints prefixed with `/api`:

- `GET /api/health` — Health check
- `GET /api/stocks/` — List all stocks
- `GET /api/stocks/{ticker}` — Get single stock (from DB)
- `GET /api/stocks/{ticker}/history` — Live daily OHLC candles + fundamentals from yfinance, plus a computed `scorecard` (the Value/Growth/Quality/Momentum Five-Petal pillars, from `scoring.py`; `null` when there aren't enough fundamentals — e.g. an ETF/junk ticker); returns `available=false` (not an error) for unknown/delisted tickers or when yfinance is unreachable, so the frontend falls back to mock
- `GET /api/stocks/{ticker}/news` — Recent company-news headlines from Finnhub (optional `name` query param sharpens relevance ranking); empty list when Finnhub is unreachable/unconfigured
- `GET /api/stocks/{ticker}/institutional` — Institutional-ownership summary (ownership %, filer count) + top holders from yfinance (Yahoo Finance `major_holders` / `institutional_holders`); returns `available=false` (not an error) when Yahoo is unreachable or the ticker has no coverage, so the frontend falls back to mock
- `GET /api/reddit/trending` — Trending tickers with aggregated mention counts, upvotes, ranks, plus merged latest price/day-change from `stock_prices` (params: `source`, `limit`)
- `POST /api/reddit/fetch` — Manually trigger ApeWisdom fetch
- `GET /api/market/season` — Latest market-mood snapshot (CNN Fear & Greed overall + VIX/Put-Call/Breadth sub-indicators + a live social-bullish % from crowd data); serves the last stored row on CNN failure, `available=false` if never fetched
- `GET /api/market/themes` — Today's market themes from Finnhub general news (empty list on failure/unconfigured)
- `GET /api/market/events` — Upcoming economic-calendar events (CPI, FOMC, jobs) from Finnhub (empty list on failure/unconfigured, or when the calendar is premium-gated on the current key)
- `GET /api/market/earnings` — Upcoming earnings reports from Finnhub's earnings calendar, covering yesterday (so an "after market close" US-time report stays visible once the server's UTC clock rolls over) through a week ahead, ranked by relevance (companies with analyst estimates / larger revenue first) so household names aren't truncated by the `MAX_EARNINGS_EVENTS` cap, then ordered by date (empty list on failure/unconfigured)
- `GET /api/institutions/` — Curated big-institution shortlist, each with a cheap 13F portfolio summary (total value + reporting period from the filing's `primary_doc.xml`); `portfolio_value=null` per row when SEC EDGAR is unreachable, but the list always renders
- `GET /api/institutions/{slug}` — One institution's latest 13F holdings (top positions aggregated by issuer, ranked by value, CUSIP→ticker resolved where known, each row carrying its portfolio `rank` + `pct`); returns `available=false` (not an error) for an unknown slug or when EDGAR is unreachable/unparsable, so the frontend falls back to deterministic mock
- `GET /api/institutions/{slug}/search?q=` — "Does this institution hold X?" — searches the institution's **entire** 13F, not just the top positions, returning matches with rank/pct/value; `available=false` when EDGAR is unreachable, empty `matches` means they don't hold it. Matches by ticker (exact) or issuer-name substring; when the query is a bare ticker it's also resolved to a company name via Finnhub and matched by name tokens, so small-caps whose CUSIP isn't in `_CUSIP_TICKER` are still findable by symbol (e.g. `AAOI` → "APPLIED OPTOELECTRONICS INC")

### Backend Structure

- **`app/main.py`** — FastAPI app with three lifespan-managed background tasks: `periodic_apewisdom_fetch` (every 10 min), `periodic_price_fetch` (every 5 min, starting 30s after boot so trending tickers exist first; it fetches prices for tickers in the latest trending snapshot), and `periodic_market_season_fetch` (every hour, CNN Fear & Greed)
- **`app/routers/`** — `stocks.py` (list/get stocks, `/history` yfinance detail, `/news` Finnhub headlines, `/institutional` yfinance ownership), `reddit.py` (trending, manual fetch trigger), `market.py` (`/season`, `/themes`, `/events`, `/earnings`), and `institutions.py` (`/api/institutions/` list + `/{slug}` 13F holdings)
- **`app/models/`** — SQLAlchemy models: `Stock`, `TrendingSnapshot`, `StockPrice`, `MarketSeason`
- **`app/schemas/`** — Pydantic response models: `StockOut`, `TrendingTickerOut`, `RedditFetchResponse`; `TickerHistoryOut` / `CandleOut` / `TickerFundamentals` / `ScorecardOut` / `PillarOut` / `PillarInputOut` (the `/history` payload); `TickerNewsItem` (`/news`); `MarketSeasonOut` / `SubIndicator` / `ThemeOut` / `EconomicEventOut` / `EarningsEventOut` (the `market` router); `InstitutionalOwnershipOut` / `InstitutionalHolderOut` (`/institutional`); `InstitutionOut` / `InstitutionHoldingOut` / `InstitutionDetailOut` / `InstitutionSearchOut` (the `institutions` router)
- **`app/services/apewisdom_fetcher.py`** — Fetches trending tickers from ApeWisdom API (`https://apewisdom.io/api/v1.0/filter/{filter}/page/{page}`) for 4 filters (all-stocks, wallstreetbets, investing, Daytrading), paginating up to 3 pages (300 tickers per filter). Bulk inserts `TrendingSnapshot` rows.
- **`app/services/price_fetcher.py`** — yfinance wrapper. `fetch_prices_async(db, tickers)` batch-downloads (50/batch) latest close + previous close and upserts `StockPrice` rows (for the trending table). `fetch_ticker_detail_async(ticker)` returns single-ticker OHLC candles + fundamentals for `/history`, backed by a 10-minute in-process TTL cache (`_detail_cache`). `fetch_institutional_async(ticker)` returns institutional ownership (ownership %, filer count, top holders) for `/institutional` from Yahoo's `major_holders`/`institutional_holders`, backed by a 1-hour cache; the pure `_institutional_from_frames` builder is unit-tested. Synchronous yfinance calls run in a thread executor. (The module also raises the `yfinance` logger to CRITICAL to silence "possibly delisted" noise from junk trending tickers.) The detail payload's fundamentals now also carry `profit_margins`/`return_on_equity`/`debt_to_equity`/`revenue_growth`/`earnings_growth`, which feed the scorecard.
- **`app/services/scoring.py`** — Pure, network-free Five-Petal scorecard model. `compute_scorecard(fundamentals, candles)` normalises each real metric to a 0–100 sub-score via piecewise-linear curves (`_lin`) and averages available sub-scores into the Value (P/E, P/B, div yield), Growth (revenue/earnings YoY, P/E compression), Quality (profit margin, ROE, debt/equity), and Momentum (vs 50-DMA, RSI-14, 52-week range, 3-mo change) pillars; returns `None` (→ frontend uses mock) unless at least Value plus one other pillar can be built. The Sentiment pillar has no live source and is appended by the frontend. Unit-tested in `test_scoring.py`.
- **`app/services/fear_greed_fetcher.py`** — CNN Fear & Greed client (`https://production.dataviz.cnn.io/index/fearandgreed/graphdata` — note `.cnn.io`, and it needs a browser User-Agent + Referer to get past Fastly bot detection). `refresh_market_season(db)` fetches + stores a `MarketSeason` row; `compute_social_bullish_pct(db)` derives a crowd-bullishness proxy from ApeWisdom rank momentum in `trending_snapshots`.
- **`app/services/finnhub_fetcher.py`** — Finnhub client. `get_todays_themes()` distills general market news into themes; `get_ticker_news(ticker, name)` returns per-ticker headlines re-ranked so stories that actually name the company surface first; `get_economic_events()` and `get_earnings_calendar()` return the upcoming economic/earnings calendars (1-hour TTL cache; the earnings calendar spans yesterday→a week out and keeps the most relevant slice via `_earnings_relevance` before ordering by date, so mega-caps like NFLX survive the cap); `get_company_name(ticker)` resolves a ticker to its company name via `profile2` (used by institution-holdings search to bridge ticker→13F issuer name). All use an in-process TTL cache and no-op (empty list/string) when `FINNHUB_API_KEY` is unset — the economic calendar is a Finnhub premium endpoint, so it also no-ops (403 → empty) on a free key.
- **`app/services/sec_13f_fetcher.py`** — SEC EDGAR 13F client (no key; requires a descriptive `SEC_USER_AGENT`). Reverse "institution → holdings" lookup for a curated shortlist of ~19 big filers (`INSTITUTIONS`, keyed by verified CIK). `list_institutions()` reads each filer's latest 13F-HR and its small `primary_doc.xml` (concurrently) for a portfolio value + period; the info-table XML is parsed once into the **full** ranked holdings list (cached 6h by `_get_full_holdings`), which backs both `get_institution_holdings(slug)` (top `MAX_HOLDINGS`) and `search_institution_holdings(slug, q, name_hint)` (matches any position across the whole portfolio, by ticker, issuer-name substring, or the resolved-company-name tokens in `name_hint` — the router passes the Finnhub-resolved name so a bare ticker finds a holding whose CUSIP we can't map). CUSIP→ticker is mapped via `_CUSIP_TICKER` where known. Pure `_holdings_from_infotable_xml` / `_parse_summary_xml` / `_matches_query` / `_name_tokens` builders are unit-tested. Degrades to `None`/empty on any upstream failure.
- **`app/database.py`** — Async engine + session factory; `get_db()` dependency for endpoint injection
- **`app/config.py`** — Pydantic BaseSettings, reads from `.env`
- **`backend/tests/`** — pytest suite: `test_price_fetcher.py` (yfinance detail NaN/empty guards + `_institutional_from_frames` mapping), `test_finnhub_fetcher.py`, `test_sec_13f_fetcher.py` (13F info-table aggregation, summary parse, accession selection, CUSIP→ticker), and `test_scoring.py` (Five-Petal pillar normalisation, RSI, and degradation-to-mock rules)

### Database Models

Four tables, four migrations (`f2d902d1e44e` — initial reddit tables, `fa9d44ea0aa4` — ApeWisdom switch, `3853f72ee731` — add stock_prices, `67d62df815c8` — add market_seasons):

- `stocks` — ticker (unique), name, sector
- `trending_snapshots` — ticker (indexed), name, rank, mentions, upvotes, rank_24h_ago, mentions_24h_ago, source (indexed), fetched_at (timestamptz, indexed); unique constraint on (ticker, source, fetched_at)
- `stock_prices` — ticker (unique, indexed), price, previous_close, day_change_pct, updated_at (timestamptz, auto-updated). One row per ticker, upserted by the price-fetch task; merged into the `/trending` response.
- `market_seasons` — append-only snapshots of overall market mood: score/rating, vix/put_call/breadth score+rating pairs (all nullable — CNN may omit a sub-indicator), social_bullish_pct, fetched_at (timestamptz, indexed). `/api/market/season` serves the most recent row.

### Server vs Client Components

Most components are **server components** — they receive pre-computed data as props and render inline-styled SVG/HTML. Five components use `"use client"`:

- `Header.tsx` — needs `usePathname()` for active nav highlighting (Dashboard / Events / Earnings, driven by `NAV_LINKS`) and the search form
- `TrendingTable.tsx` — uses `useState` for pagination (20 per page) and subreddit filter tabs; fetches from backend API on filter change
- `ScorecardPillars.tsx` — uses `useState` for pillar card expand/collapse
- `EarningsBoard.tsx` / `EventsBoard.tsx` — the `/earnings` and `/events` almanacs; each uses `useState` for pagination (10 per page), groups the current page by date, and staggers a `kabuka-rise` reveal. `EarningsBoard` markers encode the session (before open / after close); `EventsBoard` markers encode impact (high/medium/low)

The `/events` and `/earnings` routes are async server components (`app/events/page.tsx`, `app/earnings/page.tsx`) that fetch their calendar data with mock fallback and render the `EventsBoard` / `EarningsBoard` client components.

### Frontend Data Layer (`lib/`)

- **`api.ts`** — Backend API client (all fetches degrade to `null`/mock on failure). `fetchTrending(source?, limit?)` → `GET /api/reddit/trending`; `apiRowToView()` maps a row to `TrendingRowView`, using the real price/day-change when present and falling back to mock sentiment/sparkline from the ticker profile. `fetchTickerHistory(ticker)` → `GET /api/stocks/{ticker}/history`; `apiFundamentalsToView()` maps fundamentals to the `Fundamental[]` view shape. `fetchTickerNews(ticker, name?)` → `/news`. `fetchInstitutionalOwnership(ticker)` → `/institutional` (Yahoo Finance ownership; `apiInstitutionalToView` normalizes it, falling back to `buildInstitutionalMock`). `fetchMarketSeason()` → `/api/market/season` (maps CNN score to a woodblock season label). `fetchThemes()` → `/api/market/themes`. `fetchEconomicEvents()` → `/api/market/events`. `fetchEarnings()` → `/api/market/earnings`. Each has a paired `api*ToView()` mapper.
- **`known-tickers.ts`** — Flat `KNOWN_TICKERS` list (~well-known symbols) used for the Header search autocomplete.
- **`tickers.ts`** — 8 curated tickers (NVDA, SMCI, PLTR, GME, TSLA, COIN, AMD, SOFI) with hardcoded fundamentals, pillars, and posts. Unknown tickers get procedurally generated profiles via `getTickerProfile()` using FNV-1a hash as seed. `TRENDING_TICKERS` exports 128 tickers total (8 curated + sector-grouped symbols).
- **`series.ts`** — `buildPriceSeries(profile)` generates the mock candlestick series (42 candles), sentiment paths, volume bars, sparkline SVG paths, and Market Season Branch blossom/bud data. `buildRealCandles(candles)` builds the same chart geometry (candles, grid, last close, day change) from real yfinance OHLC data returned by `/history`. `buildInstitutionalMock(profile)` generates deterministic institutional-ownership mock (ownership %, filer count, top holders) for the stock detail page when Yahoo has no coverage.
- **`rng.ts`** — Seeded Park-Miller LCG + FNV-1a hash. Ensures identical renders across server and client.
- **`dashboard.ts`** — Assembles mock trending table rows (fallback) and theme data. Exports `MARKET_STATE`.
- **`composite.ts`** — Weighted-average composite score from pillar data.
- **`colors.ts`** — Shared color palette constants.
- **`types.ts`** — TypeScript interfaces: `TickerProfile`, `Candle`, `Pillar`, `Post`, `TrendingRow`, etc.

### Frontend–Backend Integration

The dashboard page (`app/page.tsx`) is an async server component that fetches trending data, the market season (`fetchMarketSeason` → `MarketSeasonBranch`), and themes (`fetchThemes` → `ThemesColumn`) from the backend at render time, each falling back to mock (`dashboard.ts` / `MARKET_STATE`) when unreachable. The `/events` and `/earnings` pages fetch their calendars (`fetchEconomicEvents` / `fetchEarnings`) the same way, with mock fallback. The `TrendingTable` client component receives initial rows as props and re-fetches from the backend API when the user clicks a subreddit filter tab (All, r/wallstreetbets, r/investing, r/daytrading) or changes the sort (mention count / day movement).

The stock detail page (`app/stock/[ticker]/page.tsx`) is an async server component that calls `fetchTickerHistory()`, `fetchTickerNews()`, and `fetchInstitutionalOwnership()` at render time (institutional ownership falls back to `buildInstitutionalMock` when Yahoo has no coverage, and renders the `InstitutionalOwnership` donut + top-holder bars). When live data is available it uses real candles (`buildRealCandles`), real fundamentals, and the real company name; otherwise it falls back to the mock `buildPriceSeries`/`profile.fundamentals`. Real headlines drive the `WhyThisSentiment` panel. It also calls `apiScorecardToPillars()` to render a live Five-Petal scorecard (Value/Growth/Quality/Momentum from the `/history` `scorecard` payload, with the mock Sentiment pillar appended), falling back to `profile.pillars` when the backend can't compute one — a "LIVE" badge and an honest footer note distinguish the two. The sentiment timeline and mention-volume charts are always mock (Reddit crowd data has no live source). When a ticker is `insufficient` (< 60 mentions), the `BareTwig` component replaces the crowd charts.

### Design System

- Fonts: Shippori Mincho (headings), IBM Plex Sans (body), IBM Plex Mono (data)
- Background: `#F5F0E5` (rice paper), text: `#211C15` (sumi ink)
- Bullish: `#4A7C59`, Bearish: `#C3423F`
- `GrainOverlay` renders a fixed SVG `feTurbulence` noise filter for paper texture
- Inside SVG `<text>` elements, use literal font names (e.g., `"IBM Plex Mono, monospace"`) since CSS variables don't work in SVG.
- In React inline styles, don't mix CSS shorthand (`border`) with non-shorthand (`borderColor`) — use separate properties (`borderWidth`, `borderStyle`, `borderColor`) to avoid rerender bugs.

### Key Patterns

- **Adding a new curated ticker**: Add a profile constant in `lib/tickers.ts` and include the ticker string in `TRENDING_TICKERS`.
- **Adding a tracked ApeWisdom filter**: Add to `FILTERS` list in `backend/app/services/apewisdom_fetcher.py`. Update the frontend `FILTERS` array and `FILTER_LABELS` map in `components/TrendingTable.tsx`.
- **BareTwig pattern**: When a ticker has `insufficient: true` (< 60 mentions), render `BareTwig` component instead of charts. The `quietNote` field provides the reason text.
- **Design reference**: When intent is unclear, consult `frontend/project/Kabuka.dc.html` (original prototype) and `frontend/chats/chat1.md` (design conversation). These are excluded from linting.
- **Backend linting**: Ruff configured with `line-length = 88`, rules `E` (errors), `F` (pyflakes), `I` (isort), targeting Python 3.12. `alembic/versions/` is excluded from linting.
- **ApeWisdom ingestion flow**: Fetch trending data per filter (paginated) → bulk insert `TrendingSnapshot` rows with source and timestamp → `/trending` endpoint queries latest snapshots and aggregates across sources by ticker.

## Agent (Claude CLI Wrapper)

An autonomous coding agent that wraps the `claude` CLI in a plan-then-execute workflow. Uses your existing Claude subscription — no API key needed.

### Billing: always the subscription, never the API

The agent invokes the local `claude` CLI, which authenticates via the OAuth **subscription login** (`~/.claude.json` → `oauthAccount`). The CLI only switches to API/cloud billing when it sees a credential env var. To guarantee subscription usage regardless of the parent shell, `runner.py` strips these vars from the subprocess environment before spawning: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX`, `AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK` (plus `CLAUDECODE`, so the child doesn't think it's nested). The `total_cost_usd` figures the agent prints are usage *estimates* the CLI reports either way — not API charges when running on the subscription.

### Commands

All agent commands must be run from the `agent/` directory:

```bash
cd agent
uv sync                                                 # Install dependencies
uv run python -m agent "Your task description"           # Full plan→approve→execute
uv run python -m agent --plan-only "Describe the task"   # Plan only, no execution
uv run python -m agent --model sonnet --budget 5.0 "Task" # Custom model/budget
uv run python -m agent                                   # Interactive prompt

# Autonomous mode: pick tasks from AGENT_BACKLOG.md / a goal and loop, no gate
uv run python -m agent --autonomous --budget 6.0
uv run python -m agent --autonomous --goal "Improve backend test coverage"
uv run python -m agent --autonomous --max-iterations 3 --branch agent/nightly
```

### Structure

Source code lives in `agent/src/agent/` (src layout, built with hatchling):

- **`cli.py`** — CLI argument parsing + plan→approve→execute→verify orchestration loop (and dispatch to autonomous mode)
- **`autonomous.py`** — `--autonomous` loop: triage (pick next task from `AGENT_BACKLOG.md`/`--goal`) → plan → execute → verify, with no approval gate. Green tasks are committed to a work branch (`agent/auto-<timestamp>`), red/no-op/errored tasks are hard-reverted (`git reset --hard` + `clean -fd`). Stops on budget, `--max-iterations`, consecutive-failure circuit breaker, empty backlog, or a `.agent-stop` file. Never pushes.
- **`git_ops.py`** — git helpers for the loop (branch checkout, HEAD snapshot, commit-all, reset/clean).
- **`state.py`** — autonomous run state (completed/failed tasks, total cost, iterations), persisted in `.git/kabuka-agent-state.json` so it is never committed
- **`runner.py`** — Invokes `claude -p` subprocess with JSON output parsing; strips billing-override env vars (see above); returns `ClaudeResult(result, session_id, cost_usd, model)` (`cost_usd` read from the CLI's `total_cost_usd` field). Handles both blocking (`--output-format json`) and real-time streaming (`--output-format stream-json`, parsing `message.content` text blocks).
- **`prompts.py`** — Builds system prompts from CLAUDE.md + plan/execute instructions
- **`verify.py`** — Programmatic post-execute gate: reads `git status --porcelain`, then runs the matching linter for each changed subtree (`backend/`→ruff, `frontend/`→eslint, `agent/`→ruff). Returns `CheckResult`s the CLI surfaces as pass/fail.
- **`display.py`** — Terminal UI with rich (panels, markdown rendering, approval prompt, verification-gate results)
- **`config.py`** — `AgentConfig` dataclass (repo_root, model, `max_budget_usd`, plan_only, stream). Budget is the only spend limiter — the installed `claude` CLI has no turn-limit flag.

### Flow

1. **Plan phase**: `claude -p --permission-mode plan` (read-only, explores codebase, outputs structured plan)
2. **User review**: Approve / Revise (with feedback) / Reject
3. **Execute phase**: `claude -p --resume SESSION_ID --permission-mode acceptEdits` (implements the approved plan)
4. **Verification gate**: independently lints the changed subtrees (`verify.py`); a lint failure exits non-zero rather than trusting the model's self-report
